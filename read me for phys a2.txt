ok so basically my game is breaker but theres a cannon shooting balls at you that will collide with your ball and mess it up. it also has powerups
collision for enemy ball(ball shot out by cannon): collides only with player ball and platform. when it hits platform it slows the platform down for a few seconds
collision for platform: collides with player ball, enemy ball, powerups, and special ball
collision for powerups: with platform only(this is how it should be)
player will have 3 lives
lose: lose all 3 lives
win: destroy all bricks
powerups: freeze cannon, and extend platform
errrr what else i missing
bricks have hp, yellow - 1hp, blue - 2hp, green - 3hp
there are a few bugs, one that might appear often is the one where collision of powerup with platform doesnt work, instead of the powerup disappearing and
player getting the buff, the powerup just gets knocked away instead and no powerup is given.
also some people use the vector pushback method to delete all objects of the thickwall but i used another method maybe thats why got bugs( the id)
but overall i think not bad lah yes maybe better than other breakers
cher b or b + pls
